# my-dictionary
A simple dictionary app with add and remove terms functionality using node.js  
This app will work as expected but the only bug is that if you put a word with a space at the end (which is does not make any sense) then the word will get added to the dictionary but it won't get deleted because while sending the request, the trailing spaces are trimmed (or at least that's what I think). So, You are welcome to use this as your personal dictionary.  

I developed this project while learning Node.JS.
